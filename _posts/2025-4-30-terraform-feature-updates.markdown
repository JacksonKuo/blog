# Problem Statement
A few years I read the [Terraform: Up & Running 2nd edtion book](https://www.amazon.com/Terraform-Running-Writing-Infrastructure-Code/dp/1098116747). The 2nd edition came out September 2019 and covers update to Terraform 0.12. A third edition came out September 26, 2022 with significant updates covering up to Terraform 1.2. And the current version of Terraform is 1.11.4. 

My understanding of the latest Terraform could use a refresher, let's figure out the latest feature updates.

# Feature Changes

* loops, if/else
* count and for_each with modules
* secret mangement
* multiple providers
* moved
