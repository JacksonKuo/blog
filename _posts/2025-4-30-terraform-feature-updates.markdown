# Problem Statement
A few years I read the [Terraform: Up & Running 2nd edition book](https://www.amazon.com/Terraform-Running-Writing-Infrastructure-Code/dp/1098116747). The 2nd edition came out September 2019 and covers update to Terraform 0.12. A third edition came out September 26, 2022 with significant updates covering up to Terraform 1.2. And the current version of Terraform is 1.11.4. My understanding of the latest Terraform could use a refresher, let's figure out what the new features are.

# Feature Changes
The 3rd edition has a nice section covering new features: *Changes from the Second Edition to the Third Edition*. Some significant changes include[^1]:
* `count` and `for_each` with modules
* `moved` blocks
* secret mangement
* multiple providers

The following will be rote walkthrough of the new sections of Terraform: Up & Running 3rd edition, along with any definitions or interesting points that standout:

#### Chapter 5 - Moved Blocks

#### Chapter 6 - Managing Secrets with Terraform

#### Chapter 7 - Working with Multiple Providers
