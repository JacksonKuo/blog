# Problem Statement
Create a chrome V3 Manifest extension that will block certain URLs. Let's use YT shorts as a good test case, which will have the added benefit of preventing me getting sucked into the mindless scrolling vortex.

# Manifest Differences
Years ago I wrote a V2 Manifest chrome extension that checks for a `x-java-serialized-object` header[^1]. But with V2 Manifest phase out in 10-10-2024[^2], let's figure out the differences between V2 and V3?[^3] [^4]

| Component | V2 | V3 |
|---|---|---|
| manifest_version | 2 | 3 | 
| webpage scripts | content scripts | content scripts | 
| extension scripts | background scripts | background service workers | 
| permissions | pemissions | host permission seperated |
| web request listeners | `chrome.webRequest...addListener` | rules |
| web request permissions | webRequestBlocking | declarativeNetRequest | 

# URL Blocker
I could have used UBlock Origin Lite or Tampermonkey or any of the multitudes of blockers on there, but I'm highly distrustful of chrome extensions and avoid running extensions unless I've personally written the code. 

#### Version 1
The new V3 Manifest uses Rules to block traffic. Google has sample code available[^5]. Unfortunately, the V3 rules are a little finicky for certain websites. For simple sites like `example.com` the result is successful.

> **example.com is blocked**  
> This page has been blocked by an extension.  
> Try disabling your extensions.  
> `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT`

However when filtering for `https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OkR5f2hElwU` things get kinda weird. The `urlFilter` I use is `||youtube.com*shorts`, however the error is now:

> **This site canâ€™t be reached**  
> The webpage at https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OkR5f2hElwU might be temporarily down or it may have moved permanently to a new web address.  
> `ERR_FAILED`  

An error page is still an error page, I guess. However the bigger issue is that shorts are still accessible through navigation. Even when `sub_frame` is added to the `resourceTypes`. Youtube appears to not use regular redirects when clicking shorts, but instead in SPA fashion updates the DOM and then rewrites the url address to `/shorts/`. This page update does not to trigger the extension block rule at all. 

Note that `declarativeNetRequest` does not need `host_permissions` to block a site. `host_permissions` is required when attempting to redirect requests.[^6]

#### Version 2
Okay. So instead of a Rules block, let's try to use a Rules redirect and see if that'll work. 

Turns out Rules redirects run into the same problem. Going directly to a `/shorts` page will properly redirect according to the extension. However for SPA the extension isn't able to catch the navigation to Shorts. 

#### Version 3
Let's write a extension that will work. Intead of rules, we'll use a script that run a `redirect.js` script on every `document_start` for only `www.youtube.com`.

```js
    "host_permissions": ["https://www.youtube.com/*"],
    "content_scripts": [
        {
        "matches": ["*://www.youtube.com/*"],
        "js": ["redirect.js"],
        "run_at": "document_start"
        }
    ]
```
