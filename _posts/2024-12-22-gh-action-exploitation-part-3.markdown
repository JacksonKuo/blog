# Problem Statement

Following a compromised Github Action via shell injection, what exploitation is possible and how does this impact Trufflehog-related workflows?

# Exploration

The Trufflehog general usage documentation uses the `pull_request`[^1] event trigger. A cursory search on Github confirms that `pull_request` is the primary event trigger used by repos.

So what's possible with `pull_request`? Forked PRs on public repos are read-only with no access to secrets. Additionally, first time forked PRs on public repos need to be manually approved before a workflow will trigger.[^2] 

The following attack scenarios are still possible.

* Access masked environment variables
* Github workflow cache blasting and poisoning
* Secondary triggered workflows: `workflow_run`, `required_workflows`

#### Access masked environment variables

The read-only GITHUB_TOKEN could be compromised, but this wouldn't grant much access. By default the workflow run logs will mask the GITHUB_TOKEN, but an attacker could read the env variable via bash.

Workflows triggered by `pull_requests` from forked public repos don't have access to secrets and therefore can't load secrets. 

But what if there's an environment variable that hold a credential that doesn't come from Github Secrets? Maybe the credential is stored in Paramstore or Secret Manager and is regularly dynamically generated. This means the cred must be fetched on each workflow run. 

An example of this would an Github App Token. This token is dynamically generated and only lasts an hour. If a workflow leverages a Github App Token[^4], this token should ideally be stored in Github Secrets. A forked PR from a public repo that tries to retrieve the secret won't have access and should gracefully fail.

Another pattern is for the Github App Token to be saved in Paramstore or Secret Manager and then loaded by the workflow. Environment variables are normally readable in the workflow run logs, but can optionally be masked. The danger is that a malicious forked PR could read these masked credentials. 

#### Github workflow cache blasting and poisoning

The definitive guide for this technique can be found here: [https://adnanthekhan.com/2024/05/06/the-monsters-in-your-build-cache-github-actions-cache-poisoning/](https://adnanthekhan.com/2024/05/06/the-monsters-in-your-build-cache-github-actions-cache-poisoning/)[^5]. The takeaway is that this attack scenario can be conducted on read-only GITHUB_TOKENs on `pull_request` workflows to tamper with build artifacts.

#### Secondary triggered workflows

The exploitation of `workflow_run` has been extensively documented.[^6] I haven't seen any literature of the impact on `required_workflows`. I may do some testing on 'required_workflow' in the future and update this section. 

# Trufflehog Impact

This has been a initial analysis of what is exploitation could be possible with the faulty Trufflehog shallow clone pattern. There doesn't seem to be an easy slam dunk  and exploitation is highly dependent on particularities of the repo and workflow. All three avenues requires more investigation on my part, but this serves as a good starting point.

Also, `If approval is required, a user with write access to the repository must approve the pull request workflow to be run.`. There are 3 settings available: `Require approval for first-time contributors who are new to GitHub`, `Require approval for first-time contributors`, `Require approval for all external contributors`, but all settings requires a manual approval.
