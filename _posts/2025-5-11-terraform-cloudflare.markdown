# Problem Statement
Configure a `bakacore.com` Cloudflare zone[^1]

# Configuration

#### DNS Setup
The old setup uses a GoDaddy registrar pointing to DO nameservers: `NS,bakacore.com, ns1.digitalocean.com`. DO DNS has A Records and another set of NS records that were generated automatically by DO. 

* GoDaddy
    - `NS,bakacore.com, ns1.digitalocean.com`
* DigitalOcean
    - `A Record, bakacore.com, IPv4`
    - `A Record, www.bakacore.com, IPv4`
    - `NS, bakacore.com, ns1.digitalocean.com.` (autogenerated)

The new setup is a Full DNS Setup that uses CF as the authoritative nameservers.[^2] [^3] When the DNS setup is set to `Proxied`, `TTL` is always set to `Auto`. 

* GoDaddy
    - `NS, bakacore.com, destiny.ns.cloudflare.com.`
    - `NS, bakacore.com, leo.ns.cloudflare.com.`
* Cloudflare
    - `A Record, bakacore.com, Status: Proxied, TTL: Auto`
    - `A Record, www.bakacore.com, Status: Proxied, TTL: Auto`

#### Pricing
Pricing is pretty nice: Free Plan - $0/month *(basic protection and performance for personal or simple websites)*[^4]

#### Encryption
`Browser` <*connection #1*> `Cloudflare` <*connection #2*> `Origin`

The encryption mode is set to `Full (Strict)`[^5] [^6]. 
* `Full`: Allows HTTP/HTTPS, does not validate the Origin HTTPS cert
* `Full (Strict)`: Allows HTTP/HTTPS, validates the Origin HTTPS cert
* `Strict (SSL-Only Origin Pull)`: Only HTTPS, validates the Origin HTTPS cert

Since we already have a valid public certificate from Certbot, `Full (Strict)` makes sense. In the future I might want to expose a HTTP endpoint. I also noticed that Connection #1 used a Google certificate. Turns out that Cloudflare's Universal Certificate can created using Google Trust Services.[^7]

#### Terraform
CF DNS records require a `zone_id`, which can be pulled using a `filter` attribute.[^8] The `zone_id` isn't necessarily sensitive, more like system information, but I'll still pull the value using terraform instead of placing the value in source code. 

```yaml
resource "cloudflare_dns_record" "bakacore" {
  zone_id = data.cloudflare_zone.bakacore.zone_id
  content = var.droplet_ip
  name = "@"
  proxied = true
  ttl = 1
  type = "A"
}

data "cloudflare_zone" "bakacore" {
  filter = {
    name = "bakacore.com"
  }
}
```

#### Issues
I ran into two minor issues. The first being that Cloudflare only supports proxying HTTPS using the following ports: `443, 2053, 2083, 2087, 2096, 8443`.[^9] I was originally on `8087`, and had to move over to `8443`. 

However going to `https://bakacore.com:443` shows this unappealing Cloudflare *Error 521: Web server is down* page. Cloudflare apparently will always accept from 443 and there's no way to turn this page off without using a Cloudflare worker. Also note that Custom Error pages can not be set for error codes between `520` and `527`.[^10] Oh well, it's nothing I really care about that much right now... 

The second issue was that my local laptop DNS was using a DNS server set by my routers ISP. This IPv6 nameserver was frequently offline for a few minutes and back online for 5 mins and would continuously cycle between down and available. This unstableness resulted in a random `DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN` errors when trying to resolve `bakacore.com`. I switched my default DNS server to `1.1.1.1` which fixed the issue.

[^1]: Note a Cloudflare zone means a domain added to Cloudflare: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/accounts-and-zones/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/accounts-and-zones/). Whereas a DNS Zone, *is a portion of the DNS namespace that is managed by a specific organization or administrator*: [https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/dns-zone/](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/dns-zone/). Essentially, a CF Zone is a CF-specific DNS Zone, but includes the ability to do additional CF features like security, performance, etc...
