# Problem Statement
Build a bunch of application defensive mechanisms. This problem can be further broken down into:

* Step 1: Build a sample app with Spring Boot
* Step 2: Build a deployment pipeline
* Step 3: Add hCaptcha
* Step 4: Upgrade deployment pipeline
* Step 5: Add custom rate limit
* Step 6: Add Twilio MFA
* Step 7: **Add Smokescreen**

# Smokescreen
The next application defense to add Smokescreen for SSRF defense. I think I've done this in the past, but good to have it on hand.
