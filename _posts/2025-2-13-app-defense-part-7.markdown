# Problem Statement
Build a bunch of application defensive mechanisms. This problem can be further broken down into:

* Step 1: Build a sample app with Spring Boot
* Step 2: Build a deployment pipeline
* Step 3: Add hCaptcha
* Step 4: Upgrade deployment pipeline
* Step 5: Add custom rate limit
* Step 6: Add Twilio MFA
* Step 7: **Add Smokescreen**

# Thought Process
The next application defense to add Smokescreen for SSRF defense.[^1] I think I've done this in the past, but good to have it on hand.

There a number of ways to deploy smokescreen in a k8s cluster.

* Deployment + Service
* DaemonSet[^2]
* Sidecar

The ideal setup is for smokescreen to be a callable service by other services.  

DaemonSet would create an instance on each node, but I don't necessary need smokescreen on every node. I also don't need smokescreen as a sidecar, since other services can't call the sidecar. So deployment + service makes sense to me.

In a perfect world, I would create K8 NetworkPolicies to restrict all internet access, and then proxy everything through smokescreen. However, in practice that seems like a bad idea. I really don't want to manage ACLs for every single service and web request in a company. 

Instead, the applications that make outbound calls with user-provided URLs should proxy their http client to smokescreen. The idea being, these types of requests are likely pretty rare in the grand schemes of all requests, and forcing all requests to go through smokescreen unnecessarily is a waste. Also securing cluster NetworkPolicies can be nontrivial in practice. I've been on assessment where an attacker is still able to egress via DNS or pivot to certain locations in the cluster that have different firewall settings. 

As for authentication, the default mTLS authentication seems a bit too unwieldy and assumes a service mesh exists to provide mTLS. Fly.io uses a simpler proxy password. If you're deny-listing all traffic then a proxy password makes sense.[^3] But if you're allow-listing all traffic then authentication doesn't really matter. 

# Smokescreen
Smokescreen is built into a image and saved into ghcr.io. Helm charts then pull the image into the cluster.

#### Application
I'm using Spring Webflux + Netty to run my webclient. This is a bit different than the typical Spring MVC + Tomcat setup, and uses things like `Mono<String>` to enable non-blocking web requests.

#### Config
Running the default smokescreen `./smokescreen` will only prevent access to internal networks. Also by default, smokescreen also tries to use mTLS for client authentication. In order to skip mTLS client validation, `allow_missing_role: true` is set in `config.yaml`. With this set, smokescreen will then use the default ACL.[^4]

Smokescreen uses a HTTP CONNECT proxy that accepts HTTP and HTTPS. 

#### Oddities
I don't see a way to set an IP address in the `acl.yaml` file. So if I need to allow an internal IP address, the following works:

`./smokescreen --allow-address 127.0.0.1`

There is a `--unsafe-allow-private-ranges` flag but it isn't required to deny/allow an IP address. 

When my Spring Boot app proxies HTTPS requests, I get an odd error back: `failure when writing TLS control frames`. Smokescreen still works as intended, but I don't get the expected: `Failed to fetch data: http, none, smokescreen/10.43.253.119:4750 => example.org/<unresolved>:80, status: 407 Request rejected by proxy`

I'm not 100% sure how smokescreen affects DNS rebinding. 

# Memory

Still looking okay on RAM, throught the app is pretty slow:

```
|       | Total  | Used   | Free  | Shared | Buff/Cache | Available |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|--------|------------|-----------|
| Mem   | 960Mi  | 755Mi  | 64Mi  | 3.0Mi  | 292Mi      | 205Mi     |
| Swap  | 1.0Gi  | 378Mi  | 645Mi |        |            |           |
```
