# Problem Statement
Do a deeper dive of LLM security with a focus on the Google DeepMind's CaMeL (CApabilities for MachinE Learning) protection

# State of the World
I did an initial dive into LLM security here: [https://jacksonkuo.github.io/blog/2025/01/02/ai-exploration-part-4.html](https://jacksonkuo.github.io/blog/2025/01/02/ai-exploration-part-4.html).

#### Microsoft Adaptive Prompt Injection Challenge[^1]
A couple things to note. At the time of my initial research the Microsoft Adaptive Prompt Injection Challenge Phase 1 was still in progress. The challenge used one or a combination of protections:

* Spotlighting:[^2] 
    - delimiters
    - data marking: input is prefixed with a special character, i.e. `InˆthisˆmannerˆCosetteˆ`
    - encoding base64
* PromptShield: 
    - black-box by Azure AI
* LLM-as-a-judge: 
    - (in the name)
* TaskTracker: 
    - looks at model’s internal states before and after processing external data and looks for drift in the task delta

In phase 1, there were 40 different levels, with the winners solving 36 levels. Phase 2 there were 24 levels with 22 being solved.[^3] The submission data is available to grok, see one of the example emails that was able to bypass the defenses and trigger an outbound call:

    "attack_attempt": "True",
    "reason": "api_triggered"
  },
```

#### Meta Llama Firewall[^4] [^5]
Meta recently unveiled their LlamaFirewall composing of the following protections:

* PromptGuard 2: `comprises classifier models that are trained on a large corpus of attacks, and which are capable of detecting both prompts that contain injected inputs`
* Agent Alignment Checks: `runtime reasoning auditor... scanner continuously monitors an agent's actions and comparing them to the user's stated objective.`
* CodeShield: `online static-analysis engine... Semgrep and regex-based rules`

#### Verdict
Given the LLM security state of the world, the prompt injection still seems difficult to solve. Spotlighting and LLM-as-as-judge relies on LLMs which can be tricked.

            }
        }
    },
```

 TaskTasker is pretty finicky based on the defense results: [https://github.com/microsoft/llmail-inject-challenge-analysis/tree/main/defense_eval/defenses_results](https://github.com/microsoft/llmail-inject-challenge-analysis/tree/main/defense_eval/defenses_results), grep for `"answer": false`.

# Dual LLMs and CaMeL
Simon Willison proposes dual LLMs[^6], however CaMeL improved this model even further[^7] [^8]. So first things first, there's a couple of different attack scenarios that are commonly used:

1. Dual LLMs: *Summarize my latest email*
2. Microsoft LLMail service: *please summarize the last emails about project X*
3. CaMeL: *Can you send Bob the document he requested in our last meeting? Bob's email and the document he asked for are in the meeting notes file.*

In the first two attack scenarios, the inherent problem is both the prompt and the email data is sent together to the LLM, which
