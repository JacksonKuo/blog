# Problem Statement
A few years I read the [Terraform: Up & Running 2nd edtion book](https://www.amazon.com/Terraform-Running-Writing-Infrastructure-Code/dp/1098116747). The 2nd edition came out September 2019 and covers update to Terraform 0.12. A third edition came out September 26, 2022 with significant updates covering up to Terraform 1.2. And the current version of Terraform is 1.11.4. 

My understanding of Terraform could use a refresher, let's figure out what are latest feature updates.
