# Problem Statement
Let's prevent secrets before they're ever committed using Trufflehog pre-commit hooks.

# Overview
So there's actually two ways to prevent commits: pre-receive and pre-commit hooks.[^1] However pre-receive hooks are only if you control the git server. Github.com doesn't support pre-received hooks, but the self-hosted Github Enterprise Server does.[^2] Trufflehog has a great pre-commit hook guide: 
* [https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/blob/main/PreCommit.md](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/blob/main/PreCommit.md)
* [https://docs.trufflesecurity.com/pre-commit-hooks](https://docs.trufflesecurity.com/pre-commit-hooks). 

Let's walk through `githooks`/`hooksPath` and the precommit framework, woohoo!

# githooks
A couple things for `githooks` - [https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks): 
* `$GIT_DIR/hooks` is not uploaded to Github.com
* *By default the hooks directory is `$GIT_DIR/hooks`, but that can be changed via the `core.hooksPath` configuration variable*
    * `$GIT_DIR/hooks` local to a git repo
* only runs this specific ``$GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-commit` file
* git config[^3] - [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration)
    * local - `git config core.hooksPath ~/.git-hooks`
    * global - `git config --global core.hooksPath ~/.git-hooks`
    * system - `git config --system core.hooksPath ~/.git-hooks`
* *can be bypassed with the `--no-verify` option*[^4]
* *non-zero status from this script causes the git commit command to abort before creating a commit*
* *The default pre-commit hook, when enabled, catches introduction of lines with trailing whitespaces and aborts the commit when such a line is found*
* *Hooks that don‚Äôt have the executable bit set are ignored*
* To quickly disable, `mv ~/.git-hooks/pre-commit ~/.git-hooks/pre-commit.disabled`

```bash
# Using Homebrew (macOS)
# brew install trufflehog
# Using installation script for Linux, macOS, and Windows (and WSL)
# curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin

mkdir -p ~/.git-hooks
touch ~/.git-hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x ~/.git-hooks/pre-commit
git config --global core.hooksPath ~/.git-hooks
git config --list
#core.hookspath=/Users/jacksonkuo/.git-hooks
```

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# Local trufflehog binary
# ~/.git-hooks/pre-commit
trufflehog git file://. --since-commit HEAD --results=verified,unknown --fail
```

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# Docker
# ~/.git-hooks/pre-commit
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/workdir" -i trufflesecurity/trufflehog:latest git file:///workdir --since-commit HEAD --results=verified,unknown --fail
```
A breakdown of the docker command: 
* `docker container run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]`[^5]
    * `docker container run` = `docker run`
    * `-rm` = removes container when exits
    * `-v` = mount a volume
    * `-i` = *keeps the container's STDIN open, and lets you send input to the container through standard input*
    * `--fail` = return exit code 183 if results are found
    * `git file://` + `/workdir` = trufflehog git command that scans local git repo
        * note that `git` is preferred over `filesystem`, since `filesystem` can't look into packfiles. The one exception is if the repository is corrupted, then `filesystem` should be used.[^6]
    * exit code[^7]
        * 0 = no errors. when verified secrets are found or no results are found. tested with canaries and live AWS tokens
        * 1 = when an error occurs
        * 183 = `--fail` set and secrets are found
